   - Possibly switch over to TailwindCSS completely.

3. **New Personal Dashboard**:
   - Develop a dedicated page for more detailed personal status updates.
   - Integrate various APIs to showcase real-time data:
     - Spotify API for current music preferences.
     - AniList/MyAnimeList API for anime/manga interests.
     - League of Legends/op.gg API for gaming statistics.

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement lazy loading for images and components.
   - Optimize database queries for faster data retrieval.

5. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Integrate a robust analytics system in the backend for better insight into visitor engagement.

6. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and implement necessary enhancements.
